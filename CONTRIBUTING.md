## Developer guidelines

### Download and Install

- Clone the project under `$GOPATH/src/github.com/ocibuilder/ocibuilder/`
- Run `dep ensure --vendor-only` or `dep ensure -v` to install package dependencies
- Build ctl binary using `make ocictl`, this will create `ocictl` cmd under `dist/`. Similarly, `make ocibuilder` will create package level binary.

### Run tests

For the entire package, follow this command
`go test -v <path-to-your-pkg>/`

For single function, add `-run <function-name>` after above command like this
`go test -v <path-to-your-pkg>/ -run <function-name>`

## Changing Types

If you're making a change to the `pkg/apis`  package, please ensure you re-run the K8 code-generator scripts found in the `/hack` folder. First, ensure you have the `generate-groups.sh` script at the path: `vendor/k8s.io/code-generator/`. Next run the following command:

```
$ make codegen
```

### Caveats

The docker and buildah spec template testing files are located under `/testing`.
